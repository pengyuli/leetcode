# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
> 
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Given nums = [1,1,2],
> 
> Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> Example 2:
> 
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
> 
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> Clarification:
> 
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
> 
> Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
> 
> Internally you can think of this:
> 
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
> 
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
 

## 思路
用双指针的解法, slow和fast, fast向前找到第一个和slow不相同的数值时候, slow向前走一步. 最后slow所在位置+1就是数组的长度
### 复杂度
time O(n) space O(1)
### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> set = new Ha
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] != nums[i]) {
                i++;
                nums[i] = nums[j];
            }
        }
        return i + 1;
    }
}
```
