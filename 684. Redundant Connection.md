# Redundant Connection
	In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
	
	The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.
	
	The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges. Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.
	
	Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array. The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.

	Example 1:
	Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
	Output: [2,3]
	Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
	  1
	 / \
	2 - 3
	Example 2:
	Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
	Output: [1,4]
	Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
	5 - 1 - 2
	    |   |
	    4 - 3
	Note:
	The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
	Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.
	
## 思路 Union Find
在union时候让在同一个cluster里面的点返回false, 这样union时候第一个返回false的就是答案.
### 复杂度
time O(n) space O(n)
### 代码
```
 class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int MAX_VALUE = 1000;
        UF uf = new UF(MAX_VALUE+1);
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (!uf.union(edge[0], edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}

class UF{
    int[] parent;
    int[] rank;
    
    public UF(int size) {
        parent = new int[size];
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        rank = new int[size];
    }
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    public boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int xr = find(x);
        int yr = find(y);
        if (xr == yr) {
            return false;
        } else if (rank[xr] < rank[yr]) {
            parent[xr] = yr;
        } else if (rank[xr] > rank[yr]) {
            parent[yr] = xr;
        } else {
            parent[xr] = yr;
            rank[yr]++;
        }
        return true;
    }
