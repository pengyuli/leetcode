# Reverse Words in a String
> Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
> 
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: "the sky is blue"
> Output: "blue is sky the"
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: "  hello world!  "
> Output: "world! hello"
> Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: "a good   example"
> Output: "example good a"
> Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
>  
> 
> Note:
> 
> A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
> Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

time O(n) space O(n)
### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] list = s.trim().split(" +");
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = list.length-1; i>0; i--) {
            sb.append(list[i]);
            sb.append(" ");
        }
        sb.append(list[0]);
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
