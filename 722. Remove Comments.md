# Remove Comments

> Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array where source[i] is the i-th line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character \n.
> 
> In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.
> 
> The string // denotes a line comment, which represents that it and rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.
> 
> The string /* denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of */ should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string /*/ does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.
> 
> The first effective comment takes precedence over others: if the string // occurs in a block comment, it is ignored. Similarly, if the string /* occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.
> 
> If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.
> 
> There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters. For example, source = "string s = "/* Not a comment. */";" will not be a test case. (Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.)
> 
> It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so /* outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.
> 
> Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.
> 
> After removing the comments from the source code, return the source code in the same format.

	Example 1:
	Input: 
	source = ["/*Test program */", "int main()", "{ ", "  // variable declaration ", "int a, b, c;", "/* This is a test", "   multiline  ", "   comment for ", "   testing */", "a = b + c;", "}"]
	
	The line by line code is visualized as below:
	/*Test program */
	int main()
	{ 
	  // variable declaration 
	int a, b, c;
	/* This is a test
	   multiline  
	   comment for 
	   testing */
	a = b + c;
	}
	
	Output: ["int main()","{ ","  ","int a, b, c;","a = b + c;","}"]
	
	The line by line code is visualized as below:
	int main()
	{ 
	  
	int a, b, c;
	a = b + c;
	}
	
	Explanation: 
	The string /* denotes a block comment, including line 1 and lines 6-9. The string // denotes line 4 as comments.
	Example 2:
	Input: 
	source = ["a/*comment", "line", "more_comment*/b"]
	Output: ["ab"]
	Explanation: The original source string is "a/*comment\nline\nmore_comment*/b", where we have bolded the newline characters.  After deletion, the implicit newline characters are deleted, leaving the string "ab", which when delimited by newline characters becomes ["ab"].
	
	
## 思路
有两种情况:

1. 遇到//, 那么这一行之后的string都可以忽略
2. 遇到/\*  \*/, 如果遇到了/\*, 我们设定一个状态inBlock为true, 那么block里面的string都不考虑, 直到遇到\*/

本题还有个问题就是Example2里面的情况, 这样一来如果遇到block, 那么与block开始的同行的字符不能删除, 要留着和block之后同行的字符组成一行

### 代码

```
class Solution {
    public List<String> removeComments(String[] source) {
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        boolean inBlock = false;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (String s : source) {
            char[] charArray = s.toCharArray();
            for (int i = 0; i < charArray.length; i++) {
                if (!inBlock) {
                    if (charArray[i] == '/' && i + 1 < charArray.length && charArray[i+1] == '/') {
                        break;
                    } else if (charArray[i] == '/' && i+1 < charArray.length && charArray[i+1] == '*') {
                        inBlock = true;
                        i++;
                    } else {
                        sb.append(charArray[i]);
                    }
                } else {
                    if (charArray[i] == '*' && i+1 < charArray.length && charArray[i+1] == '/') {
                        inBlock = false;
                        i++;
                    }
                }
                
            }
            if (!inBlock &&sb.length() > 0) {
                res.add(sb.toString());
                sb = new StringBuilder();
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
