# Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

	Example: 
	
	Input: 19
	Output: true
	Explanation: 
	12 + 92 = 82
	82 + 22 = 68
	62 + 82 = 100
	12 + 02 + 02 = 1
	
	
	
## 思路
这道题如果不记录已经访问过得节点会超时, 所以用一个set记录访问过得数字. 然后迭代的对数字进行操作, 直到出现重复为止.

### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        while (!set.contains(n)) {
            set.add(n);
            int tmp = 0;
            while (n>0) {
                int k = n % 10;
                tmp += k * k;
                n = n /10;
            }
            n = tmp;
            if (n == 1) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}

```
