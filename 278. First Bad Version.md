# First Bad Version

> You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.
> 
> Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.
> 
> You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.
> 
> Example:
> 
> Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.
> 
> call isBadVersion(3) -> false
> call isBadVersion(5) -> true
> call isBadVersion(4) -> true
> 
> Then 4 is the first bad version. 

## 思路 (二分法)
这道题要寻找满足条件的target中的第一个, 所以用模板1可能会错过target, 所以选用第二个模板
## 复杂度
time:O(log(n))
## 代码
```java
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1, right = n;
        while (left + 1< right) {
            int mid = left + (right -left) /2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid;
            }
        }
        if (isBadVersion(left)) {
            return left;
        } else {
            return right;
        }
    }
}

```
