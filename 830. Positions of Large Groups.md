# Positions of Large Groups
> In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.
> 
> For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".
> 
> Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.
> 
> The final answer should be in lexicographic order.
> 
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
> Output: [[3,6]]
> Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: "abc"
> Output: []
> Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
> Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

```
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> largeGroupPositions(String S) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        if (S==null || S.length() == 0) {
            return res;
        }
        int i = 0;
        while (i<S.length()) {
            int start = i;
            while (i+1 < S.length() && S.charAt(i+1) == S.charAt(i)) {
                i++;
            }
            int end = i;
            if (end - start >= 2) {
                res.add(Arrays.asList(start, end));
            }
            i++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
