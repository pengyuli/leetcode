# Open the Lock

> You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10 slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0' to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
> 
> The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
> 
> You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
> 
> Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.
> 
> Example 1:
> Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
> Output: 6
> Explanation:
> A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
> Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
> because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
> Example 2:
> Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
> Output: 1
> Explanation:
> We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
> Example 3:
> Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
> Output: -1
> Explanation:
> We can't reach the target without getting stuck.
> Example 4:
> Input: deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"
> Output: -1
> Note:
> The length of deadends will be in the range [1, 500].
> target will not be in the list deadends.
> Every string in deadends and the string target will be a string of 4 digits from the 10,000 possibilities '0000' to '9999'.


## 思路
相当于找最短路径, 所以用BFS的方法. 我觉得这道题的难点在于对于string的处理.

### 复杂度
time O(A^N) A is the number count, N is the 9 in this case
Space O(A^N)

### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public int openLock(String[] deadends, String target) {
        Queue<String> q = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> dead = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(deadends));
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        String cur = "0000";
        if (!dead.contains(cur)) {
            q.offer(cur);
            visited.add(cur);
        }
        int step = 0;
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            int size = q.size();
            for (int i= 0; i < size; i++) {
                cur = q.poll();
                if (cur.equals(target)) return step;
                for(int j=0; j<4; j++) {
                    char c = cur.charAt(j);
                    int n = c-'0';
                    int[] pool = {(n+1)%10, (n-1+10)%10};
                    
                    for(int o : pool) {
                        String next = cur.substring(0, j)+o+cur.substring(j+1);
                        if(!visited.contains(next) && !dead.contains(next)) {
                            q.offer(next);
                            visited.add(next);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            step++;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

```
