# Clone Graph
> Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a label (int) and a list (List[UndirectedGraphNode]) of its neighbors. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.
> 
> 
> OJ's undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):
> Nodes are labeled uniquely.
> 
> We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
>  
> 
> As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.
> 
> The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.
> 
> First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
> Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
> Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.
>  
> 
> Visually, the graph looks like the following:
> 
>        1
>       / \
>      /   \
>     0 --- 2
>          / \
>          \_/
> Note: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don't need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.

## 思路 BSF
用map来记录已访问的节点. key是老节点, value是新节点. 用Qeueu来做bsf, 每次遍历queue中的节点时候, 把他的邻居节点不在map中的都加入map中, 然后把map中当前节点的克隆节点的邻居都填满
### 复杂度
 time O(VE) in the worst case, where V is the # of nodes and E is the number of Edges
 Space O(V)
### 代码
```
public class Solution {
    public UndirectedGraphNode cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return node;
        }
        Map<UndirectedGraphNode, UndirectedGraphNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        Queue<UndirectedGraphNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        UndirectedGraphNode newNode = new UndirectedGraphNode(node.label);
        map.put(node, newNode);
        q.offer(node);
        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode cur = q.poll();
            for (UndirectedGraphNode n : cur.neighbors) {
                if (!map.containsKey(n)) {
                    q.offer(n);
                    UndirectedGraphNode tmp = new UndirectedGraphNode(n.label);
                    map.put(n, tmp);
                }
                map.get(cur).neighbors.add(map.get(n));
            }
        }
        return newNode;
        
    }
}
