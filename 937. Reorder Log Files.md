# Reorder Log Files
> You have an array of logs.  Each log is a space delimited string of words.
> 
> For each log, the first word in each log is an alphanumeric identifier.  Then, either:
> 
> Each word after the identifier will consist only of lowercase letters, or;
> Each word after the identifier will consist only of digits.
> We will call these two varieties of logs letter-logs and digit-logs.  It is guaranteed that each log has at least one word after its identifier.
> 
> Reorder the logs so that all of the letter-logs come before any digit-log.  The letter-logs are ordered lexicographically ignoring identifier, with the identifier used in case of ties.  The digit-logs should be put in their original order.
> 
> Return the final order of the logs.

 
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
	Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
	
## 思路
重写comparator, 如果都是数字就返回0, 如果是字母就先比较string 如果相同比较identifier

### 复杂度
time NlogN
### 代码

```
class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        Arrays.sort(logs, (log1, log2) -> {
            int index1 = log1.indexOf(' ') + 1;
            int index2 = log2.indexOf(' ') + 1;
            char c1 = log1.charAt(index1);
            char c2 = log2.charAt(index2);
            if (c1 <= '9') {
                if (c2 <= '9') return 0;
                else return 1;
            }
            if (c2 <= '9') {
                return -1;
            }
            int res = log1.substring(index1).compareTo(log2.substring(index2));
            if (res == 0) {
                res = log1.substring(0, index1).compareTo(log2.substring(0, index2));
            }
            return res;
            
        });
        
        return logs;
    }
}
