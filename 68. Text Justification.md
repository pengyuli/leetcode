# Text Justification
>Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

>You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

>Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

>For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

>Note:
>
>A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
The input array words contains at least one word.

    Example 1:

    Input:
    words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
    maxWidth = 16
    Output:
    [
       "This    is    an",
       "example  of text",
       "justification.  "
    ]
    Example 2:

    Input:
    words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
    maxWidth = 16
    Output:
    [
      "What   must   be",
      "acknowledgment  ",
      "shall be        "
    ]
    Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
                 because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
                 Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
    Example 3:

    Input:
    words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
             "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
    maxWidth = 20
    Output:
    [
      "Science  is  what we",
      "understand      well",
      "enough to explain to",
      "a  computer.  Art is",
      "everything  else  we",
      "do                  "
    ]


##　思路

第一步要做的是找到每一层所有的单词.
然后根据每一层来讨论:
1. 如果只有一个单词, 那么这层就是单词+空格
2. 如果这是最后一层, 那么单词之间一个空格, 多余的空格留到最后
3. 单词之间的空格平均分配

### 复杂度
time O(n* maxWidth)

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            sb.append(" ");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
