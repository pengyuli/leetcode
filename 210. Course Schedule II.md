# Course Schedule II
> There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
> 
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
> 
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
> 
> There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
> Output: [0,1]
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
>              course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
> Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
> Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
>              courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
>              So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
> Note:
> 
> The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
> You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## 思路
和I一样, 用拓扑排序, 输出答案
### 复杂度
time O(n) Space O(n)
### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int[] findOrder(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[] res = new int[numCourses];
        int m = numCourses -1;
        ArrayList<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0 ; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
            inDegree[prerequisites[i][1]]++;
            graph[prerequisites[i][0]].add(prerequisites[i][1]);
        }
        for (int i =0; i< numCourses; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int k = queue.poll();
            res[m--] = k;
            for (int i = 0 ; i < graph[k].size(); i++) {
                int t = graph[k].get(i);
                inDegree[t] -= 1;
                if (inDegree[t] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(t);
                }
            }
        }
        if (m == -1) {
            return res;
        }
        return new int[0];
    }
}
