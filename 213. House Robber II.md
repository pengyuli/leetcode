# House Robber II
> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
> 
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: [2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
>              because they are adjacent houses.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

## 思路
与I不同的是增加了环形, 所以可以分为两种情况讨论, 一种是第一个元素到倒数第二个元素, 一个是第二个元素到最后一个
### 复杂度 
time O(n) space O(n)
### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        return Math.max(helper(nums, 0, nums.length-1), helper(nums, 1, nums.length));
    }      
    private int helper(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (end - start == 1) return nums[start];
        int n = end-start;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = nums[start];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[start], nums[start+1]);
        for (int i = start+2; i < end; i++) {
            dp[i-start] = Math.max(dp[i-start-1], dp[i-start-2] + nums[i]);
        }
        return dp[end-start-1];        
    }
}
```
