# House Robber
> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
> 
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
> Output: 12
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
>              Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

## 思路DP
dp[i]代表以i结尾的当前最大值, dp[0]就是nums[0], 但是dp[1] 就要是nums[0] 和nums[1]中较大的值. 转移方程就是dp[i] = max(num[i] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1])

- state: dp[i] i结尾的当前最大值
- function： dp[i] = max(num[i] + dp[i - 2], dp[i - 1])
- initial： dp[0] = nums[0]; dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1])
- end : return dp[n-1]

### 复杂度
time O(n) space O(n)
### 代码

```
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length <= 1) {
            return nums.length == 0? 0:nums[0];
        }
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        dp[0] = nums[0];
        dp[1] = Math.max(nums[1], nums[0]);
        
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(nums[i] + dp[i-2], dp[i-1]);
        }
        return dp[nums.length -1];
    }
}
```
