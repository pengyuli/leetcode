# Max Area of Island

> iven a non-empty 2D array grid of 0's and 1's, an island is a group of 1's (representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.
> 
> Find the maximum area of an island in the given 2D array. (If there is no island, the maximum area is 0.)
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],
>  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
> Given the above grid, return 6. Note the answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
> Example 2:
> 
> [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
> Given the above grid, return 0.

## 思路 DFS
用一个列表记录节点是否被访问过, 然后对每个节点进行dfs

### 复杂度
time O(mn) space O(mn)
### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0].length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int res = 0;
        boolean[][] visit = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                    res = Math.max(res, find(grid, visit,i, j));
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
    private int find(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visit, int i, int j) {
        if (i < 0 || i >= grid.length || j < 0 || j >=grid[0].length || visit[i][j] || grid[i][j] != 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        visit[i][j] = true;
        return 1 + find(grid, visit,i-1, j) + find(grid, visit,i+1, j) + find (grid, visit,i, j-1) + find(grid, visit,i, j+1);
        
    }
}
