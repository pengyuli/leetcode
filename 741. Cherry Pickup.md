# Cherry Pickup

In a N x N `grid` representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.

 

- 0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;
- 1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;
- -1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.

 

Your task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:

 

- Starting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);
- After reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;
- When passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);
- If there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.

 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid =
[[0, 1, -1],
 [1, 0, -1],
 [1, 1,  1]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).
4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].
Then, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.
The total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.
```

 

**Note:**

- `grid` is an `N` by `N` 2D array, with `1 <= N <= 50`.
- Each `grid[i][j]` is an integer in the set `{-1, 0, 1}`.
- It is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.



## 思路

可以转化成从两个人一起从[0, 0] 走到[n-1,n-1]的题, 由于两个人一起走, 所以路径 x1, x2, y1, y2可以用x1, x2,y1就能表示 因为x1+y1= x2+y2

dp\[x1]\[y1]\[x2]用来表示x1, x2, y1, y2上的最大得数, 
那么对于dp\[x1]\[y1]\[x2], 他的最大值就是下面的两个只和

- dp\[x1 - 1]\[y1]\[x2] : A down, B right
- dp\[x1]\[y1 - 1]\[x2] : A right, B right
- dp\[x1 - 1]\[y1]\[x2 - 1]: A down, B down
- dp\[x1]\[y1 - 1]\[x2 - 1]: A right, B down

```
if the Max of these values is negative, then we don't have a path to this point
        else we have: dp[x1][y1][x2] = Max + grid[x1 - 1][y1 - 1] + grid[x2 - 1][y2 - 1](if x1 != x2 && y1 != y2) else we
        only add once.
```

### 代码

```Java
class Solution {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n+1][n+1][n+1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], Integer.MIN_VALUE);
            }
        }
        dp[1][1][1] = grid[0][0];
        for (int x1 = 1; x1<=n; x1++) {
            for (int y1 = 1; y1 <=n; y1++) {
                for (int x2 = 1; x2 <=n; x2++) {
                    int y2 = x1 + y1 - x2;
                    if(dp[x1][y1][x2] > 0 || y2 < 1 || y2 > n || grid[x1 - 1][y1 - 1] == -1 || grid[x2 - 1][y2 - 1] == -1){
                        continue;
                    }
                    int cur = Math.max(Math.max(dp[x1 - 1][y1][x2], dp[x1 - 1][y1][x2 - 1]), Math.max(dp[x1][y1 - 1][x2], dp[x1][y1 - 1][x2 - 1]));
                    if(cur < 0){
                        continue;
                    }
                    dp[x1][y1][x2] = cur + grid[x1 - 1][y1 - 1];
                    if(x1 != x2){
                        dp[x1][y1][x2] += grid[x2 - 1][y2 - 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][n][n] > 0 ? dp[n][n][n]: 0;
    }
}
