# K Closest Points to Origin
> We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).
> 
> (Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)
> 
> You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
> 
>  
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1
> Output: [[-2,2]]
> Explanation: 
> The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
> The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
> Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
> We only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2
> Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
> (The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)

## 思路
看到K问题一般都首先想到PQ, 这道题里到0点的距离其实就是自己的连个元素平方和, 所以PQ的排序按照平方和从小到大排
### 复杂度
time O(log k) space O(k)
### 代码

```
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int K) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> q = new PriorityQueue<int[]>((a,b)->b[0]*b[0]+b[1]*b[1]-a[0]*a[0]-a[1]*a[1]);
        for (int[] list: points) {
            q.offer(list);
            if (q.size()>K) {
                q.poll();
            }
        }
        int[][] res = new int[K][2];
        for (int i = K-1;i>=0; i--) {
            res[i] = q.poll();
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
