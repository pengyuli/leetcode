# String Compression
> Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
> 
> The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
> 
> Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
> 
> After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.
> 
>  
> Follow up:
> Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?
> 
>  
> Example 1:
> 
> Input:
> ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
> 
> Output:
> Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]
> 
> Explanation:
> "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
>  
> 
> Example 2:
> 
> Input:
> ["a"]
> 
> Output:
> Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]
> 
> Explanation:
> Nothing is replaced.
>  
> 
> Example 3:
> 
> Input:
> ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
> 
> Output:
> Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].
> 
> Explanation:
> Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
> Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.
>  
> 
> Note:
> 
> All characters have an ASCII value in [35, 126].
> 1 <= len(chars) <= 1000.

## 思路
用一个index遍历array, 用另外一个index来写array. 需要注意的是count可能不只是个位数, 所以要把count转换成string再转换成charArray得到count的个数
### 复杂度
time O(n) Space O(1)
### 代码

```
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int index = 0, curIndex = 0;
        while (index < chars.length){
            chars[curIndex] = chars[index];
            int count = 0;
            while (index < chars.length && chars[index] == chars[curIndex]) {
                index++;
                count++;
            }
            curIndex++;
            if (count > 1) {
                for (char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) {
                    chars[curIndex++] = c;
                }
            }
        }
        return curIndex;
    }
}

```
