# 207. Course Schedule
> There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
> 
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
> 
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
> Output: true
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
> Output: false
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
>              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
> Note:
> 
> The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
> You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

## 思路 拓扑排序
这道题可以转化成为有向图是否有环, 用拓扑排序的解法做. 用一个int[]来表示每个节点的入度, 用一个ArrayList[]来表示每个节点的后续节点列表. 首先根据已给的数组找到所有点的入度然后通过BFS的方法从入度为0的点开始遍历
### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        int[] inDegree = new int[numCourses];
        ArrayList<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[numCourses];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < prerequisites.length; i++) {
            inDegree[prerequisites[i][1]]++;
            graph[prerequisites[i][0]].add(prerequisites[i][1]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < inDegree.length; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int course = queue.poll();
            for (int i = 0; i < graph[course].size(); i++) {
                int k = graph[course].get(i);
                inDegree[k]--;
                if (inDegree[k] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(k);
                }
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < inDegree.length; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] > 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

```
