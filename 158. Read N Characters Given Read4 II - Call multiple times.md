# Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times
> Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.
> 
>  
> 
> Method read4:
> 
> The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.
> 
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
> 
> Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.
> 
> Definition of read4:
> 
>     Parameter:  char[] buf
>     Returns:    int
> 
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]
> Below is a high level example of how read4 works:
> 
> File file("abcdefghijk"); // File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
> char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 4. Now buf = "efgh", fp points to 'i'
> read4(buf); // read4 returns 3. Now buf = "ijk", fp points to end of file
>  
> 
> Method read:
> 
> By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from the file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly.
> 
> The return value is the number of actual characters read.
> 
> Definition of read:
> 
>     Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
>     Returns:	int
> 
> Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]
 

	Example 1:
	
	File file("abc");
	Solution sol;
	// Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.
	sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
	sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
	sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
	Example 2:
	
	File file("abc");
	Solution sol;
	sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
	sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
	
## 思路
因为是连续读取, 需要一个prebuf记录当前的buf, 然后还要记录buf的访问index和size
### 代码

```
public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    char[] preBuf = new char[4];
    int preIndex = 0;
    int preSize = 0;
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {

        int count = 0;
        while (count < n) {
            if (preIndex < preSize) {
                buf[count++] = preBuf[preIndex++];
            } else {
                preSize = read4(preBuf);
                preIndex = 0;
                if (preSize == 0) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
