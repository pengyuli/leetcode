# Knight Probability in Chessboard
> On an NxN chessboard, a knight starts at the r-th row and c-th column and attempts to make exactly K moves. The rows and columns are 0 indexed, so the top-left square is (0, 0), and the bottom-right square is (N-1, N-1).
> 
> A chess knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

> 
> Each time the knight is to move, it chooses one of eight possible moves uniformly at random (even if the piece would go off the chessboard) and moves there.
> 
> The knight continues moving until it has made exactly K moves or has moved off the chessboard. Return the probability that the knight remains on the board after it has stopped moving.

> Example:
> 
> Input: 3, 2, 0, 0
> Output: 0.0625
> Explanation: There are two moves (to (1,2), (2,1)) that will keep the knight on the board.
> From each of those positions, there are also two moves that will keep the knight on the board.
> The total probability the knight stays on the board is 0.0625.

> Note:

> N will be between 1 and 25.
> K will be between 0 and 100.
> The knight always initially starts on the board.

## 思路 DP
dp[k][i][j] 对于第k次的i,j位置, 他的概率是第k-1次, 所有能到达i, j 位置的可能概率*1/8
初始化只有r,c的概率是1, 遍历数组k次, 找到每个格子的概率然后相加

### 复杂度
time O(kN^2) space O(n^2)

### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public double knightProbability(int N, int K, int r, int c) {
        double[][] dp = new double[N][N];
        int[][] dir = {{1,2}, {1,-2}, {-1,2}, {-1,-2}, {2,1}, {2,-1}, {-2,1}, {-2,-1}};
        dp[r][c] = 1;
        for (;K>0; K--) {
            double[][] dp2 = new double[N][N];
            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                    for (int m = 0; m < 8; m++) {
                        int x = i + dir[m][0];
                        int y = j + dir[m][1];
                        if (x>= 0 && x < N && y >= 0 && y < N) {
                            dp2[x][y] += dp[i][j] /8;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            dp = dp2;
        }
        double res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                res += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
