# Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
> Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
> 
> If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
> 
> Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
>              Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

## 思路 BF
暴力解法, 计算所有的买入和卖出的结果, 得到最大profit

### 复杂度
时间O(n^2) space O(1)
### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[j] - prices[i]);
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}

```

## 思路 one pass
遍历一遍数组, 用一个变量来记录最小买入值, 然后每次记录下当前值和最小值的差价作为利润.
### 复杂度
time O(n) space O(1)
### 代码

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices == null || prices.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int min = prices[0];
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > min) {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, prices[i] - min);
            } else {
                min = prices[i];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }
}

```
