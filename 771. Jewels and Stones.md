# Jewels and Stones
> You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
> 
> The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
> Output: 3
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
> Output: 0

## 思路
用hashset把J中元素都记录下来, 然后遍历S
### 复杂度
time O(J + S) space O(J)

### 代码
```
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (char c : J.toCharArray()) {
            set.add(c);
        }
        int res = 0;
        for (char c : S.toCharArray()) {
            if (set.contains(c)) {
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
