# Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
> Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.
> 
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
> 
> Example 1:
> 
> Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
> 
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> Example 2:
> 
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
> 
> Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> Clarification:
> 
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
> 
> Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
> 
> Internally you can think of this:
> 
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
> 
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }


## 思路 双指针
依旧是使用双指针, slow和fast, 并且用一个int count来计数, 每次fast指针和他之前一位比较, 如果相同且计数器没有达到k 计数器+1, slow指针也向前走一步. 如果fast和之前一位不同, slow向前走一位, 计数器计数1.
### 复杂度
time O(n) space O(1)

### 代码
```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int k = 2;
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int m = 1;
        int count = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i-1]) {
                if (count < k) {
                    nums[m] = nums[i];
                    m++;
                    count++;
                }
            } else {
                nums[m] = nums[i];
                count = 1;
                m++;
            }
            
        }
        return m;
        
    }
}
```
