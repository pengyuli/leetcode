# Thread VS Process


Processes: a process is an instance of a computer program that is being executed. A process contains one or more threads.
Thread: a thread of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.
Difference between processes and thread
- Process runs in separate memory spaces, and threads run in shared memory spaces 
- Process is independent from other processes, but threads are depend on other threads. 
- Process is controlled by operating system, and threads are controlled by programmer in a program
