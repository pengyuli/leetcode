# Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
> Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
> 
> The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.
> 
> Note:
> 
> Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
> You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
> Example:
> 
> Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
> Output: [1,2]
> Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

## 方法 TwoPointer
因为数组是有序的, 用双指针的方法从左右向中间找到结果
## 复杂度
时间O(n) 空间O(1)
##代码
``` java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = {-1,-1};
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int sum = nums[left] +nums[right];
            if (sum > target) {
                right--;
            } else if (sum < target) {
                left++;
            } else {
                res[0] = left + 1;
                res[1] = right + 1;
                return res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}```
